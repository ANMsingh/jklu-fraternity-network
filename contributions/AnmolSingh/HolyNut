The Average male ejaculate is 2 millilitres, that's 2e-6 meters cubed.

At 9.52e28 nuts per second you would have 1.904e23 cubic meters of cum.

The ball of cum would be 175 times the size of earth after 1 second.

To achieve this, the cum will have rushed out at 11.8% the speed of light in all directions.

Due to the relationship between volume and radius, the speed of cum will eventually reduce towards zero. But not before collapsing under its own gravitational field.

The Schwarzschild radius formula is: r=2GM/c^2

approximating the density of cum as that of water (p=997kgm-^3), substituting the volume of a sphere (V=4/3*pi*r^3) and rearranging for the radius gives sqrt(3*c^2/(8*pi*G*p)) = 4.019e11m.

This is comparable to the distance from the earth to the sun: 1.5e11m

Luckily the ball of cum will be unable to reach this size before the end of the month, as it would take 45466 years before an event horizon would form.

Still, the final stats are:

Volume: 1.699e28m^3

Ball wilth radius 1.59e9 m,

Thats still an impressive 4.14 times the distance to the moon

The mighty ball of cum would become the new dominant gravitational body in our solar system, being 8.516 times the mass of the sun. Being majority H2O, the gravitational forces would rip the molecules apart, dragging the heavier oxygen to the core whilst the lighter hydrogen would remain on the outside, hydrogen near the core boundary would begin fusion into helium, while the heavier oxygen would either wait until the hydrogen reserves were depleted or begin fusion into silicon immediately, idk maybe both.

For reference, all of this shit violates conservation of energy. So if you'd like to pass this challenge you'd need to get *REALLY* lucky and have each cum spontaneously come into existence for the amount of time permitted by the Heisenbug uncertainty principle: Et>h/2pi

With Each cum weighing 2 grams, Using E = mc^2 that gives us 1.7946e14 joules

Hence the cum could only exist for 2.938e-49 seconds

For reference, This is already far smaller than a plank second, and might as well be infinitely smaller than our current best measurement of time on the order of 1e-21 s.

However, doing the challenge at this Immense rate, faster than the universe source code can even perceive, you can complete the paltry "Extreme Destroy Dick December" in a mere 2.415e-15 seconds. Which leads me to my final point:

The physical limit for nuts in a single day as permitted by the laws of physics, at a FUCKING COLOSSAL rate of 2.938e49 nuts per second, is a truly horrifying 2.538432x10^54 times. For the laws of physics to hold, each nut must be deleted within 2.9x10^-49 seconds of being created.
